# Hanzisize
Hanzisize is a chrome extension built in React that allows selective resizing of page content based on language.
The inspiration for this chrome extension came from my own frustration trying to read very small Chinese script online. I wanted to enlarge the font-size of Chinese characters without changing the size of any other elements on the page.

The current version of Hanzisize is able to selectiely resize Chinese, English, or Japanese script. Other languages may be added later based on demand.
