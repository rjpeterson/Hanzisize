# Hanzisize

## What is it?
Hanzisize is a Chrome extension built using React that allows selective resizing of page content based on the selected language.

## Why do I need it?
The inspiration for this Chrome extension came from my own frustration trying to read very small Chinese script online. I wanted to enlarge the font-size of Chinese characters without changing the size of any other elements on the page.

## How does it work?
The current version of Hanzisize is able to selectiely resize Chinese, English, or Japanese script. Other languages may be added later based on demand.

The current functionality allows for easy increasing and descreasing font-size on the page with a few limitations.
For example, the font size of an element can never be smaller than it was when the page was first loaded. This prevents headers and other large font size elements from shrinking while paragraph text grows.
